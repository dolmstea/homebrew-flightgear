flightgear-homebrew
===================

A tap containing the necessary formulae to build Flightgear flight simulator with homebrew.

These formula should be stable and are "almost" compliant with homebrew standards. The work that
remains to be done includes making these formula play nice with brew audit.

We are now developing a with-scenery option that will enable the user to download the entire
FlightGear scenery repository and install it into the appropriate location.
Also in the works is the addition of the GUI launcher. This is still far off.
